# CoderHack Leaderboard API

A RESTful API service developed using Spring Boot and MongoDB for managing the leaderboard of a coding platform. The platform awards users with badges based on their scores in a contest.

## Problem Description

This service manages the leaderboard for a specific contest on a coding platform. Each user has a unique ID, a username, and a score. The leaderboard awards virtual badges to users based on their scores. The service includes functionality to register users, update scores, and manage badges according to the following criteria:

- `1 <= Score < 30` -> Code Ninja
- `30 <= Score < 60` -> Code Champ
- `60 <= Score <= 100` -> Code Master

## Requirements

- The API handles **CRUD operations** for user registration and management.
- Each user has the following fields:
  - **User ID**: Unique Identifier (UUID)
  - **Username**: Name of the user
  - **Score**: Userâ€™s score (0 <= Score <= 100)
  - **Badges**: Virtual awards based on score

## Features

- **User registration** with an initial score of 0 and no badges.
- **Score update** which also updates badges according to the score.
- **User retrieval**, sorted by scores in descending order.
- **User deletion**.
